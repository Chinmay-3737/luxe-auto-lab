It's a digital space where premium cars are showcased with the same sophistication as a high-end showroom, enhanced by the precision and interactivity of a modern tech interface. The layout is dynamic, clean, and designed to evoke a sense of cutting-edge innovation.\n\nExecution Blueprint:\n1. The Grid as a Foundation: A 12-column grid provides the underlying structure, ensuring a balanced and responsive layout.\n2. Asymmetrical Layering: Elements are strategically layered and positioned asymmetrically to create depth and visual interest, breaking away from traditional static layouts.\n3. Neon Accents: A vibrant neon red (#FF0000) is used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements and create a sense of futuristic technology.\n4. Glassmorphism: Components like buttons and containers will incorporate a frosted-glass effect to add depth and a modern touch.\n5. Micro-Interactions: Subtle animations and transitions are used to provide feedback and enhance the user experience, creating a sense of interactivity and responsiveness.\n6. Typography as a Visual Element: Headings are large and impactful, serving as visual anchors and guiding the user through the content.",

The 'primary' color is the brand's 'safety signal'; use it exclusively for high-impact visual anchors such as numbered badges, active navigation states, or primary call-to-action buttons. Do not overuse the 'primary' color for large backgrounds. Use 'surfaceDark' for container elements that sit on top of the 'secondary' background to create subtle depth. The 'divider' color should be used for the thin, precise horizontal lines that structure the content.",

Similarly, 'secondary' and 'secondaryForeground' offer high contrast suitable for all text sizes. The 'primary' color with 'primaryForeground' generally meets minimum contrast requirements for large text or graphical UI components (like the numbered badges shown) but may fall short of WCAG AA for small body text; therefore, avoid using 'primary' as a background for fine print.

Asymmetrical Layering: Elements are strategically layered and positioned asymmetrically to create depth and visual interest, breaking away from traditional static layouts.\n3. Neon Accents: A vibrant neon red (#FF0000) is used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements and create a sense of futuristic technology.\n4. Glassmorphism: Components like buttons and containers will incorporate a frosted-glass effect to add depth and a modern touch.\n5. Micro-Interactions: Subtle animations and transitions are used to provide feedback and enhance the user experience, creating a sense of interactivity and responsiveness.\n6.
